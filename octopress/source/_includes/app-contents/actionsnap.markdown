## ActionSnap (2010 - 2012)

### Description

A popular Android camera app developed in 2010. It takes multiple shot and combines to one photo and allows users to choose different layouts and effects. The app was featured on Android market a few times and got over 2M downloads. We also integrated Steply, a social photo sharing platform, to get more users by cross promoting each other's products.

### My role and challenges

It was a company's side project, the goal was to let the team try out Android sdk and build something for fun. We built the prototype in a week then I contributed most of the codes in my personal time. 

It was not an easy task to build a camera app in 2010, the first problem is the memory limit, devices that time only allowed 16MB memory for each process so you can only downscale the image to apply color effect to pixels, and it was even harder to combine 4 or 9 photo to one. 

Another challenge was different devices support. After the app launched, we met quite many manufacture specific problems especially on camera, some cannot see the preview, some can see the preview but the result image was corrupted, as we did not have enough testing devices, we spend a few round of releases to fix the problems. Moreover, all Android 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are released in 2010 and there were new camera related api in every version. Camera orientation support was added in 2.2, front camera support was added in 2.3. I also did an internal sharing on [image orientation](https://speakerdeck.com/oursky/image-orientation-in-actionsnap) issues.
