Recently read some articles from Julie Zhuo's, she is a Product design director in Facebook. Although her posts are not about engineering, I still feel connected with most of the topics.

["Don't be a gatekeeper"](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/5c48db173662)
 
{% blockquote %}
If you are somebody with an incredible amount of passion for high quality, you may be compelled to become a gatekeeper at some point in your life.
{% endblockquote %}
    
I read this article last night, this is interesting because I just had a similar "discussion" with my team leads last week about the schedule. We were doing things like other (average) startups do, fast development, no test, keep changing, dirty code everywhere. This worked for a new products, but as the usage increases, the required quality of the app should also increase.

I am not only not happy about the way we work, I also feel that I am losing control of my work. I start feeling I will be no longer able to maintain the app's performance, code quality, and even do a accurate time estimation for new tasks. This is a very serious problem as I considered myself the gatekeeper of the project, even I am not the one to make (any) product decision. 


{% blockquote %}
If you are a gatekeeper or find yourself thinking we need a gatekeeper, the thing that is broken or missing is trust. So instead of judging yes or no, good or bad, consider this instead: what could I do to make it so that I have more trust in the people around me?
{% endblockquote %}

The result of the discussion was that, I asked for a proper scheduling so that I can at least do my job as a developer, and hope this can change the trust thing a little bit.

## Futher reading

There are more articles from Julie's [medium](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass). 

["Why Designers Leave"](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/d0aa3b8af9b7)

{% blockquote %}
Every person who works in a creative field has an aspiration for her work, a yearning for that ideal plane which is the culmination of her taste.

When an environment fails, over and over and over again, to provide her with a means to follow her internal compass, then she will leave.

If you are in a position to influence that kind of environment, take heed. Lay the foundations for a space that nurtures, that yields the kind of work the best creative people can be proud of.
{% endblockquote %}


["Quality is not a tradeoff"](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/bcddf7c85553)

{% blockquote %}
Quality is a bar, not a tradeoff.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
It just doesn’t work like that.

Why? Because to create high-quality work, there has to be a minimum acceptable bar. And high-quality creators cannot trade off below that bar. They simply can’t. 
{% endblockquote %}
