Found some cool projects on Github but still do not have time to play with it. Here is my list containing projects I found in last 6 months:


### Action Bar

* [flavienlaurent/NotBoringActionBar](https://github.com/flavienlaurent/NotBoringActionBar) - this is the future of action bar, top of my list.

### Facebook

* [facebook/rebound](https://github.com/facebook/rebound) - though not everyone is happy with the facebook app on Android, it is so nice to see Facebook opensource some Android projects.

### UI

* [SpecialCyCi/AndroidResideMenu](https://github.com/SpecialCyCi/AndroidResideMenu) - not so Android accroding to current design guideline, but... why not? :D
* [6wunderkinder/android-sliding-layer-lib](https://github.com/6wunderkinder/android-sliding-layer-lib)
* [umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel](https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel) - this is the second top of my list
* [etsy/AndroidStaggeredGrid](https://github.com/etsy/AndroidStaggeredGrid) - was featured in [Android Design in Action: Our Favorite Design Details](http://youtu.be/GjUxEddmjFw?t=20m26s), should keep an eye on this team.
* [edmodo/cropper](https://github.com/edmodo/cropper) - image cropper UI
* [gabrielemariotti/colorpickercollection](https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/colorpickercollection)

### Network

* Have not spend much time on studying network library, not sure what kind of improvement I will get on using this
* [square/okhttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
* [Android/volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley) - this is not on github, just put it here also... [Google IO session](https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/325304728)

### other

* [path/android-priority-jobqueue](https://github.com/path/android-priority-jobqueue) - I implemented my own, but it is always good to learn from other's code
* [linkedin/hopscotch](https://github.com/linkedin/hopscotch) - product tour, didn't notice this project is from LinkedIn until I write this post lol
* [koush/ion](https://github.com/koush/ion) - a full featured image download lib, with a gif player integration that could help me :p
* [dlew/android-movies-demo](https://github.com/dlew/android-movies-demo) - some nice animations, though I don't think this is a good way to use the ViewPager
