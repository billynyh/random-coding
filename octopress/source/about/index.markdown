My name is Billy Ng, I am a software engineer living in Hong Kong. I am currently Android developer of [9GAG](http://9gag.com), responsible for providing native Android experience to our large user base. The app got <b>over 5M downloads</b> and was featured on Google Play store.

Working on projects that have millions of people using it everyday pushes me write better software. I am passionate about Android UI performance, app architecture, building reusable components and customizing tools to improve the team's development process. I have experience on building apps from start to launch on my own, while I also enjoy working in team to build bigger things.

I stared Android development in 2010, developed a popular Android camera app [Action Snap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=oursky.gesturecam) which got over 2M downloads. Before fully switched to Android, I had a few years of web development experience using Python, Ruby on Rails and PHP.

I was active in programming contest and competed in ACM ICPC World final 2008 in Banff, Canada, representing The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Outside my programmer life, I love travelling, hiking, camping, playing badminton, football(soccer) and weiqi(Go).
