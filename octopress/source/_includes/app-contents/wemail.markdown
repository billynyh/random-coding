## WeMail (2014 Oct - Present)

### Description

Email client app is a trending area recently, WeMail uses a new approach to organize email, instead of changing users' behavior like Mailbox, WeMail groups email by sender and provides other advanced filter UI that allows you navigate faster.


### My role and challenges

I joined the team right before their first public release, responsible for identifying the critical performance issues, prioritized the tasks according to remaining time and decided to fix before or after launch. In last few years I was working on code base that I built from group up, joining this team gives me opportunity to learn how to pick up other's code fast and use my experience to improve the team's workflow and code structure.
